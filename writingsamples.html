  Beginning/Purpose:


For the innovative MSU community, the concept of reuse has been implemented on campus since WWII. Operations began voluntarily under the guise of the Salvage Yard and eventually morphed into what is now known as the Surplus Store. In the early 1990’s, the Surplus Store added staff in order to improve operations and relationships with campus departments, ultimately increasing revenue.


The MSU Surplus Store exercises landfill diversion through the methodology of reducing, reusing, and recycling. Since 1999, MSU Surplus has steadily increased revenue from $400,000 annually to $3 million annually. Departmental revenue has increased from $100,000 annually to over $1.2 million annually. In addition, MSU Surplus has decreased landfill waste by 52% since 2009. The success that MSU Surplus has had in these endeavors can be attributed to hiring a passionate and dedicated staff, taking on all requests regardless of difficulty, and establishing strong relationships with university departments.



Resources:


Facility:

MSU Surplus has been located in three different venues, starting with a 16,000 square ft. building and then moving into a 73,000 square ft. building to be shared with Recycling/Waste, Bikes, and the Campus Sustainability Staff.


Equipment:

Equipment provided by the university to launch operations in 1990 included an 18 ft. box truck, a fork truck, and a high-low. Equipment was also acquired in 2009 with the addition of two box trucks, truck and dock scales, and a 16 ft. flatbed trailer front end loader.


Budget:

    The MSU Surplus store is entirely self-supporting.

    General Fund Money has never been requested.

    Revenue is created through Surplus Store Sales and Student Storage Services.



Staff:

    Operations began with two full-time employees and a student employee.

    In the early 1990's, expansion occurred with the addition of students and temporary employees.




Challenges:


Being a pioneer in its field, the MSU Surplus store has had to deal with several challenges. How does the MSU Surplus Store maximize the potential of a limited space in order to make greater revenues?



Analyzing Sales Reports:

It is crucial to be aware of the amount of space items take up on the sales floor as there is limited real estate to work with. Another integral factor is the amount of revenue said items produce. If these items take up a great deal of space but do not produce correlating revenue, adjustments must be made in order to maximize the potential of the sales floor.


Producing Enough Revenue:

    MSU Surplus collects books and staffs book listers in order to bring in approzimately $10,000 in annual revenue.

    MSU Surplus collexts approximately 20,000 pounds of clothing annually to increase profits.

    E-waste and other electronics were brought ion.

    MSU Surplus offers a free e-waste and electronics drop-off for personal items from the MSU Community in order to produce additional revenue.

    The staff shares responsibilities and employees understand that these responsibilities overlap. This cuts down on a higher payroll that would result from offering more specialized positions.

                                         

Limited Space:

The sales floor was extended into the front parking lot, enabling a higher volume of items to be sold.





Staffing and Training


The MSU Surplus Store staffs a dynamic and passionate team without whom operations would not be possible.

Labor Team

Consisting of employees that are capable of lifting and moving, the labor team is responsible for many daily operations.


Sales Staff:

Duties of sales staff include cashiering and customer service.


Sales Floor Coordinator:

The sales floor coordinator is responsible for pricing, organization, and customer service. While pricing cannot be taught as it is an acquired skill learned on a trial and error basis, the ability to research current market value can be taught.


Sales Manager:

Responsible for overseeing sales as a whole, the sales manager must focus on looks, pricing, cash register operations, staffing, and delegation of tasks.


Lead Driver:

The lead driver participates in the pick-up and drop-off of goods. The use of an efficient route is crucial. It is also essential to be detail oriented which includes ensuring that items picked up remain undamaged and keeping like items together.


HAZ MAT Training:

Environmental health and safety training is essential for all employees. In this way, employees will be able to recognize environmental hazards and will understand how to properly deal with these environmental hazards.



Data Tracking/POS System:

The Surplus Store utilizes a hand-built Point Of Sale program in File Maker. This program can track the amount of weight entering or leaving the building, entering the free pile, or entering the landfill. This is instrumental in documenting the amount of waste prevention that takes place. The system also tracks sales amounts and categorizes products sold. More information can be found here.



Failures/Successes:

Because sustainability is a relatively new concept, most everything is a learning experience. When a mistake is recognized, such as selling an item for less than it is worth, the most important thing is to identify what can be done to prevent the same mistake from occurring again. While this process is heavily based on trial and error, the Surplus Store has reaped great rewards from such experimentation. The Surplus Store has been a huge actor in the 52% decrease of waste sent to the landfill since 2009. From 1999 to 2013, revenue has steadily increased from $400,000 annually to $3 million annually. During the same period, revenue returned to departments increased from $100,000 annually to over $1.2 million annually.

  <p> <strong><a href=" "> Communications Audit</a> </strong> </p> <p> This piece comprehensively reviews the external communication strategy of Buckle, a corporate retailer.
  </p>
  <p>
  <marquee direction= "left">
  Communication Audit: Buckle
The Buckle just might be the smartest retailer out there. This multi-million dollar company sells trendy clothes for both men and women. Young adults are specifically targeted; however, people of all ages shop Buckle. The company is also recognized for placing an obscene emphasis on designer denim, boasting that the only people who don’t like jeans from The Buckle are those who have never tried them on before. Buckle has worked diligently to create a name for itself as the go-to destination for designer denim and has brought in many loyal patrons through these efforts. Such a feat is due largely in part to Buckle’s use of rhetoric and both internal and external communication.
	Picture this: it’s Friday, synonymous with pay-day, and you find yourself at the mall. You decide to stop in at Buckle. Upon entering the store, you are greeted with a friendly “Hello!” from a bubbly sales associate. She asks what you are shopping for and when you mention a certain brand of jean, she grabs you five new styles in your size. She opens a dressing room for you, asks you your name, and introduces herself as Meg. As you begin to try on the jeans, Meg checks back frequently to bring you perfectly-matched tops and to make sure that everything is fitting correctly. She even brings shoes and accessories. Yes, this is shopping made easy, and you find yourself wanting almost everything that Meg brings you. At the register, she cheerily rings up your purchases and then walks around the counter to hand you your shopping bag. As you leave the store, you find yourself pondering why you would ever shop anywhere else!
Yes, why would you shop anywhere else? The aforementioned tactics that employees implement make shoppers feel good.  In certain cases, sales associates are able to boost self-confidence and even over-all morale simply by properly servicing a shopper as in the above example. Patrons perceive sales associates as credible due to the way they dress and exhibition of product knowledge. The company’s mission statement, (“To create the most enjoyable shopping experience possible for our Guests.”), shows the great value that Buckle places on its patrons. The company’s ultimate goal is to make itself known as a “Five Star Retailer”. This in itself is a unique idea. Of the numerous things that come to mind upon hearing the phrase “Five Star”, such as hotels or restaurants for example, it would be unprecedented to instantly picture a store from the mall. Yet, with Buckle’s exemplary customer service, a component that is due in part to the fact that employees are paid on commission, the aforementioned goal doesn’t seem so far-fetched. 
Artifacts
The first step is hiring employees that are willing to provide exemplary service. Welcome artifact one, the “Careers That Fit” Booklet. A cardinal pillar of Buckle is recruiting efforts- after all, how could any business become Five Star without a Five Star Staff? Thus, the purpose of the booklet is to draw in new employees. This is made obvious by cues such as the title. Buckle scatters this literature throughout its stores, leaving us with the safe assumption that the target audience is anyone who shops Buckle. The cover features three well-dressed individuals with huge smiles. This in itself is influential persuasion- those who work for Buckle are fashionable and happy. Anyone exposed to this booklet may find themselves wondering if they fit the bill. The artifact utilizes attractive language to entice individuals to work for Buckle. Employees aren’t just employees but rather “teammates”. Positions such as the Sales and Management Intern and Manager in Training are followed by descriptions of Buckle’s entrepreneurial culture and focus on personal development as opposed to a mundane synopsis of duties that are typically expected in retail. Wages are detailed as “competitive” to avoid scaring off employee prospects by mentioning commission. Additionally, Buckle highlights their benefits available to employees and the “established career path”. Both of these components are attractive as, when considering a job, individuals typically look for some type of workplace stability as well as opportunities for advancement. 
 Once employees have been brought in, how can it be ensured that they will do their job up to company standards? While managers have a great role in this, at Buckle, training is further fostered through use of the SPG or Sales Presentation Guide. This form is a half sheet of paper featuring a table that helps sales associates keep track of their guest’s name, sizes, and preferred brands. Its purpose is to make sure that employees are fully servicing each guest. This is made clear when studying the layout of the SPG. The top half provides space to track how many jeans, tops, shoes, active wear and outerwear options have been tried on by the guest. The bottom half features services to mention including Buckle Charge (the company credit card), layaway, denim fit cards (to track guest’s sizes for future reference), and guest loyalty (to add guests to a personalized email list). There is also a section labeled B-Referrals so that employees are constantly considering if their guest could be a possible recruit. If the guest is a good fit for Buckle they are a “yes” if not, they are a “know”; they might know someone who could work at Buckle. This type of verbiage is an example of the company’s optimistic culture. Most of the materials distributed by Buckle are framed in a positive manner. The aforementioned services are included on the SPG because they bring back more business which in turn creates bigger paychecks and ultimately happier employees. Employees are expected to constantly fill out their SPGs throughout their shift. After, SPGs are stored and analyzed to see which products and services sales associates consistently showed and which products and services they neglected. This helps the company constantly improve. The SPG is a crucial element in keeping customers happy. With the proper usage of the SPG, Buckle can ensure that employees are satisfying guests while portraying a credible image. 
Another interesting internal text comes in the form of the Buckle B Happy Notebook. The bright sunshine yellow hue of the notebook instantly makes one think of positivity. This then is a successful ploy as the purpose of the book is to “create positive change” within those who read it, in this case Buckle employees specifically. This can be noted by a description on the inside cover, persuading the reader that it is possible to “rewire” the brain to become more “positive and successful”. This raises the question then as to whether or not happy people are more productive than those who wouldn’t consider themselves to be happy. It can be concluded that this is the case when trying to understand why Buckle Corporate would feel the need to distribute these books to their employees. The book is a 31 Day Challenge: each day is labeled with a number and an inspiring quote. The first day boasts “Normal is average. If we merely do what is normal, we remain average. –Shawn Achor”. There are then five labeled sections: three gratitudes, journaling/recording, exercise, meditation, and acts of kindness. This notebook appeals to an employee’s emotions. It portrays the message that Buckle cares about the well-being of employees and thus makes employees feel appreciated which leads to happiness.  
Now that we have seen how Buckle finds employees and trains them in a unique company culture, it is only natural to wonder if there is a method to the madness. Does the rigorous customer service prove to be beneficial from a monetary stand-point? Introducing artifact number four: a press release dated January 9th, 2014. The text describes the net sales for December 2013, down 2.2% based upon pre-set company goals. This figure is then compared to the net sales of December 2012, which were down 2.8%. While it is routine for companies to release monthly sales reports, the purpose of publicizing this statement is to show that Buckle’s sales are improving. This, in turn, alludes to the company’s overall success. The truth in this statement is evident as instead of simply saying that sales were down, an element of comparison is added to provide a positive swing on things in typical Buckle fashion. Due to the form of the text and the content, it is obvious that the media is the target audience. While the purpose is obligatory, even in their press releases, Buckle stays true to itself.
	
Finally, the Buckle.com website provides great material for analysis as a website is cumulative representation of a company. We have seen how Buckle attracts employees, now; we can see how Buckle attracts consumers. While the website is there because websites are integral in modern society, it also serves to bring in more business for the organization. The home page is emblazoned with the message “Denim Guide: Find Your Fit.” The confidence in this message furthers the premise that Buckle can and will be able to find anyone a pair of jeans that actually fit. Also featured on the home page is an attractive couple holding onto each other and smiling. The pair exemplifies the “Buckle” look: they are decked out in a mess of designer attire and display relaxed, happy expressions. The target for this website is fashion-conscious young men and women. This is evident because of the age of the models, the vibrancy of the color scheme (as vibrancy is often associated with youth), and the relaxed nature of certain “young and hip” verbiage used (outfit instead of ensemble for example). The goal of enticing people to shop Buckle seems to be successful based on the web page: who wouldn’t want to look like that attractive couple? A banner labeled “Winter Sale: New Product Just Added” also helps entice customers as everyone likes to save money.
Conclusion
	As a set, these texts provide just a glimpse of how Buckle approaches business differently than other retailers. Buckle attributes success to no one single feat but rather to “countless things each done a tiny bit better than a competitor”. The artifacts show how the company has attempted to differentiate itself in terms of company culture, recruitment efforts, and product. The language used is really quite effective. Powerful words such as “positive”, “high-energy”, and “team-oriented” draw in consumers. The models used are also effective. Because they are attractive in terms of the socially-constructed idea of beauty, consumers will surely want to look like them. In order to do this, they will have to buy clothes from Buckle. Based on this analysis, it becomes apparent how essential rhetoric and writing is to any organization. Without writing, Buckle would struggle to recruit and train. It would be difficult to report financial aspects of the business to the media and also challenging to display product to those outside of shopping malls. Basically Buckle, like most other businesses, is dependent on written communication for almost every facet of business, including the cores of recruiting, monetary components, and employee cultivation. This analysis is also proof that communication is invaluable in today’s modern society. Rhetorical resources are a critical avenue for an organization to gain exposure. The company actually has control of the image that is projected to the public in that they can regulate what is written and circulated to the public. This is huge because the better public opinion is of a business, the more monetarily successful said business will be.

  Literary History:
 For as long as I can remember, books have been a constant in my life. I can recall sitting on my grandmother’s lap by a brilliant forsythia bush, totally enthralled by the words of Blueberries for Sal, my favorite story at age five. The book’s lively illustrations coupled with my grandmother’s soothing narration certainly cemented a great love for me. I can clearly remember myself at age 16, awake late at night and furiously typing my “novel” on an archaic Dell computer. Although I never finished my text, I sincerely enjoyed feeding my imagination. Now, I no longer fit in the folds of my grandmother’s skirt, I can’t fathom relying on that old laptop to catalogue my thoughts, and the stories have most certainly changed, however, my love for reading and writing has remained hopelessly and irrevocably the same.  
 As a child, I was home-schooled for kindergarten and first grade. While I was read to every single day, I had difficulty mastering the skill myself. This of course means that I sincerely struggled in learning to write. Not wanting to force my competence, my mother calmly admonished that I would acquire these vital skills when I was ready.  At the start of second grade, I was off to public school and still unable to create or decipher the strange hieroglyphs that decorated my most prized possessions. The shame of being placed into the lowest level group of my English class dripped from my being like sticky sap oozing from a maple. I knew that I simply could not remain illiterate and decided quite promptly to do something about it.
 Every night, my mother listened to me read. I struggled greatly at the start, drawing out syllables and softening vowels when they should be hard. The rounded letters swam before my eyes as I fought and fought to decipher their meaning. We also went through my weekly spelling words with vehemence, often until I burst into tears from frustration. I can recall carefully scratching out letters on a pad of graphing paper over and over until even the characters that were familiar to me seemed foreign. When my mother wasn’t available to help me, my grandmother was present to assist me in my great journey to literacy. While I can clearly remember even now how my illiteracy terrorized me at this time, the results were undeniable. English soon became my favorite subject and I slowly moved up through the groups until I was in the highest level. A performance test at the end of my second grade year indicated an 8th grade reading and writing level.
	My mastery of reading and writing truly culminated in third grade. I had the privilege of learning under an incredible teacher, Mrs.Dunsmore. She excelled not only at teaching the technical aspects of writing, but at fostering the creative aspects as well. During free time, my class was always being encouraged to think up stories and then put them to paper. At first, I was hesitant to write. The thought of someone else, even Mrs.Dunsmore, reading and potentially criticizing my work, petrified me. Mrs.Dunsmore diligently urged me to write regardless and eventually I found myself loving the practice and began to write frequently and feverishly. On one such occasion, I began to write a tale about a girl named Annabel and her journey to acquire the perfect Christmas gift for her care-taker, a kindly woman named Eenie. The story took me quite a while to write and, upon completion, I felt extremely proud of my labor of love. 
	A few months later, Mrs.Dunsmore was addressing the class as a group before we divided up based on our reading and writing levels. She held up a copy of a literary magazine, Creative Connections, and announced that someone in our class had written a submission that was chosen to be featured in the magazine. I loved the magazine as I had spent numerous hours sitting in the library nook, leafing through the pages covered in text. I sat in sheer suspense and jealousy with the rest of our class, almost unable to handle the suspense. As Mrs.Dunsmore began to read the story, I flushed with excitement and pleasure as I recognized the words to be none other than my very own. I was a published author! 
Although there was no real pivotal moment in my life in which I discovered that I was suddenly able to read and write, I eventually realized that I had given myself an invaluable gift. This realization was certainly aided by the publication of my story.  In the years to come, I relied heavily on reading and writing as a creative outlet for anything from times of emotional trauma to times of personal triumph.  I have always believed that stories are incredibly sacred as they are so powerful despite intangibility. This is why academic tutoring fuels a great passion for me. What is more important than a communal sharing of thoughts, tales, and lessons? And the force that makes this possible? Now that is a ship that is truly remarkable.
The fact remains undisputed that, without the struggles that I endured to learn how to read and write, I would not be the writer that I am today. I feel that the first time that I was published truly was a defining moment in my life because this event helped me to finally understand my love for writing, the joy and solace that is a product of simple fabrication and the materialization of said fabrication. It is my firm belief that because I found it so challenging to master literacy, I am that much more grateful for my competence. This gratitude helps to fuel my eternal passion for writing, it makes me eager to create and excited about the writing process in general.
	As a writing consultant, my experiences will prove to be extremely helpful. I can understand a myriad number of writers, from those who perhaps aren’t entirely comfortable with the English language to those who have crafted wondrous stories. I will never forget how disheartening it was to be recognized as one of the worst writers in my class all of those years back. Because of this I am forever humbled and will always desire to help those who struggle as I once did. The successes I’ve experienced as a writer, including my first publication, help me understand how important a piece of writing can be to its author and necessitate my complete respect of any piece of writing that I work on.
 Above all, patience is a skill that I will rely heavily on in my tutorial endeavors. This same patience exhibited through my grandmother, mother, and Mrs.Dunsmore is something that I hope to be able to emulate as a tutor. Patience is key in any difficult or frustrating situation. For many, writing can prove to be both difficult and frustrating. Exhibiting patience in all situations will prove to be an effective tactic for any writer that I work with. It is of the utmost importance to not be defined by all our experiences. With that being said, we must always recognize events that have shaped us as people, as students, and even as writers.
